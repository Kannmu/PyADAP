# PyADAP

Python Automated Data Analysis Pipeline

## Usage

Run Application.py and follow GUI instructions

## Goals

- The final test report will be generated in the same directory as the uploaded source data file. Within this directory, create a new analysis results folder named after the source data file. All generated and saved content should be placed within this folder.

- Subsequent analysis methods (e.g., data transformation/parametric tests/non-parametric tests) will be dynamically selected based on statistical test results (including normality and sphericity assumptions).

- Implement a scientifically rigorous statistical analysis workflow, maximizing the automation level of the data analysis pipeline for user-friendliness.

- The generated HTML report should feature a clean, Apple-inspired aesthetic and comprehensively present analysis results. Utilize visualization libraries (e.g., Chart.js and Anime.js) to create interactive and intuitive data representations.
